README.txt for ans2all
======================

asn2all is a agent from ncbi_agents package. This agent is able to create
formatted files from GenBank and RefSeq databases in ASN.1 format. One of the
supported formats is XML. This agent is NOT able to create a XML file from
ENZYME in ASN.1 format.

So, this directory will only contain a thin wrapper description around this agent.
